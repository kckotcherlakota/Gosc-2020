### PROJECT DETAILS: PYTHON DEEP LEARNING INFERENCE ON VIDEO
### ORGANIZATION: OPENCV 

### ABSTRACT 
The goal of this project is to develop a high-level helper class in python to perform optimized inference on videos.for an improved video inference we use a new method of adaptive enhancement and upscaling of video feed ​. And impose a powerful topological prior to the bounding box , which prevents the solution from excessive shrinking and ensures that the user-provided box bounds the segmentation in a sufficiently tight way

### FEATURES 
1. Adaptive Enhancement functionality of the video feed
2. Upscaling functionality to the source video
3. Improved image segmentation with the bounding box using topological
prior

### Possible Mentors​: ​Justin Shenk

### PROJECT OBJECTIVES
1. To create individual add-on classes for adaptive enhancement and upscaling functionality which can easily be used.
2. To provide a custom value based customization for video enhancement and upscaling functionality
3. To create an add-on class for the image segmentation ​with the bounding box using topological prior

### MEASURABLE OUTCOMES:
1. To create individual add-on classes for adaptive enhancement and upscaling functionality which can easily be used.
2. To provide a custom value based customization for video enhancement and upscaling functionality
3. To create an add-on class for the image segmentation ​with the bounding box using topological prior
ACHIEVING PROJECT GOALS
The entire project can be broadly classified into three phases through completion
Phase 1-​Deliverable before the first Mid-Term evaluation
1.1. Add-on class functionality for the video upscaling 1.2 creating database for the image segmentation 1.3 testing various algorithms with our database 1.3 building class for the image segmentation function ​with the bounding box using topological prior 1.4 declaration of the validation parameters
Phase 2-​Deliverable before the second Mid-Term evaluation
2.1 working on the custom value based customization for upscaling 2.2 testing the video upscaling function 2.3 building a add on class for the video enhancement functionality 2.4 testing image segmentation
Phase 3-​Deliverable before the final evaluation
3.1 working on the custom value based customization for the video enhancement functionality 3.2 testing all the three classed 3.3 documentation of the parameters with minimum and maximum values for customization 3.4 debugging of the classes along with the parameters
Wishlist: ​Can be implemented if all the above tasks are completed successfully and the programme is yet to end, also desired to be taken up post GSoC
● Additional class which uses the objects calls of all the above classes with a standardized value parameters, without individually calling the parameters for each sub classes
