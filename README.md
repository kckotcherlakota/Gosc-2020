### PROJECT DETAILS: PYTHON DEEP LEARNING INFERENCE ON VIDEO
### ORGANIZATION: OPENCV 

### ABSTRACT 
The goal of this project is to develop a high-level helper class in python to perform optimized inference on videos.for an improved video inference we use a new method of adaptive enhancement and upscaling of video feed ​. And impose a powerful topological prior to the bounding box , which prevents the solution from excessive shrinking and ensures that the user-provided box bounds the segmentation in a sufficiently tight way

### FEATURES 
1. Adaptive Enhancement functionality of the video feed
2. Upscaling functionality to the source video
3. Improved image segmentation with the bounding box using topological
prior

### Possible Mentors​: ​Justin Shenk

### PROJECT OBJECTIVES
1. To create individual add-on classes for adaptive enhancement and upscaling functionality which can easily be used.
2. To provide a custom value based customization for video enhancement and upscaling functionality
3. To create an add-on class for the image segmentation ​with the bounding box using topological prior
